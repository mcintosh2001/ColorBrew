```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown
```{r}
source("SomePlots.R", echo = FALSE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

## Results {.tabset}

### Output MetColorBrewer
Plots generated using the new MetColorBrewer package, downloaded from GitHub. Schemes generated using paintings in the Metropolital Museum of Art in NYC
```{r}
panel1
```

### Output ColorBrewer
Plots generated using the new ColorBrewer package, downloaded from CRAN 
```{r}
panel2
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
